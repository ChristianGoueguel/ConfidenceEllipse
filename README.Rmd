The objective of the `ConfidenceEllipse` package is to compute the confidence ellipse for a given bivariate normal data. The size of the ellipse is determined by the confidence level, and the shape is determined by the correlation structure between the variables. The confidence level is usually chosen to be 95% or 99%, and the resulting ellipse contains the points that are expected to lie within the multivariate distribution. Points outside the ellipse might be considered outliers.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `ConfidenceEllipse` like so:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
# remotes::install_github("ChristianGoueguel/ConfidenceEllipse")
```

## Example

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(magrittr)
```

### Dataset

The dataset is comprised of 13 different measurements for 180
archaeological glass vessels from different groups (Janssen, K.H.A., De
Raedt, I., Schalm, O., Veeckman, J.: Microchim. Acta 15 (suppl.) (1998)
253-267. Compositions of 15th - 17th century archaeological glass
vessels excavated in Antwerp.)

```{r}
data(glass, package = "chemometrics")
data(glass.grp, package = "chemometrics")
```

```{r}
df <-
  cbind(glass.grp, glass) %>%
  as_tibble() %>%
  rename(group = glass.grp) %>%
  modify_at("group", as_factor)
```

```{r}
df %>%
  ggplot() +
  aes(x = MgO, y = Cl, colour = group, shape = group) +
  geom_point(size = 3L) +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set1", direction = 1) +
  labs(
    x = "MgO (wt.%)",
    y = "Cl (wt.%)",
    caption = "FIG. 1: Concentrations of MgO and Cl in glass vessels (Janssen et al. 1998.)") +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(
    legend.position = "none",
    panel.grid = element_blank()
    )
```
